# Spotmap
Spotmap is a Wordpress plugin that shows all the recent positions of a Spot beacon 
([findmespot.com](http://findmespot.com)).

Via a shortcode a user is able to embed the map everywhere in wordpress (pages, posts, ... ).
The map uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and as the underlying map it uses the [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/about)
This way it is much more useful compared the limited options Spot is [offering for this](https://faq.findmespot.com/index.php?action=showEntry&data=71).

There are still a lot of things that could be improved!
