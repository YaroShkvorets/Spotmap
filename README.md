# ðŸ—º Spotmap 
Spotmap is a Wordpress plugin that can show an embedded map  with all the recent positions of a Spot beacon 
([findmespot.com](http://findmespot.com)).

The map uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and shows the  [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/about)
This way it is much more useful compared the limited options Spot is [offering for this](https://faq.findmespot.com/index.php?action=showEntry&data=71).
It uses [wp cron](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_cron) to regular check the Spot API for new points.
Furthermore it uses [Leaflet.fullscreen](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen)

Currently the Plugin will show all positions since configuring the plugin. The following screenshot was taken after using the plugin for 3 months:

## Installation 
Just login to your Wordpress Dashboard and go to `Dasboard > Plugins > Add New`.
Search for "Spotmap" and install the first search result.
After installing the plugin you can head over to `Settings > Spotmap` and enter your Feed ID of your Spot Feed.

If you like to test out the newest Developement Version download the current master branch [here](https://github.com/techtimo/spotmap/archive/master.zip).

## Usage
Use the following Shortcode to display the map:
```
[spotmap mapcenter="last" height="500"]
```
With `mapcenter` you can configure if the map centers all points (`all`) or zooms in to the latest known position (`last`). Default value: `all`

With `height` you set the height of the map in pixels. Default `400`.

 
## FAQ
### How do I get my Feed ID
First of all you need to create a XML Feed in your Spot account. If you have multiple devices, select only one.
The link to the newly created feed looks similar to the following link: `http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Wl3diTJcqqvncI6NNsoqJV5ygrFtQfBB`
Everthing after the `=` is your feed id:
`0Wl3diTJcqqvncI6NNsoqJV5ygrFtQfBB`
