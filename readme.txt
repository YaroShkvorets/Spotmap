== Description ==

âš  In order to use this plugin you will need a spot emergency beacon from ([SPOT LLC](http://findmespot.com)) and an active subscription.

Use the following Shortcode to display the map in a post or page:
```
[spotmap mapcenter="last" height="500"]
```
With `mapcenter` you can configure if the map centers all points (`all`) or zooms in to the latest known position (`last`). Default value: `all`

With `height` you set the height of the map in pixels. Default `400`.


== Installation ==

After installing the plugin, head over to your Dashboard  `Settings > Spotmap` and enter your Feed ID of your Spot Feed.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get my Feed ID? =
First of all you need to create a XML Feed in your Spot account. If you have multiple devices, select only one.
The link to the newly created feed looks similar to the following link: `http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Wl3diTJcqqvncI6NNsoqJV5ygrFtQfBB`
Everthing after the `=` is your feed id:
`0Wl3diTJcqqvncI6NNsoqJV5ygrFtQfBB`
